I am a Pennsylvania Licensed Professional Counselor (PC010040) and have thoroughly enjoyed helping people in various settings for the past eight years. In 2006, I received my Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice, minoring in Psychology from Temple University. I completed my Master of Arts in Applied Clinical Psychology from Penn State University in 2012.

My experience includes working with diverse groups in forensic settings, outpatient therapy, and inpatient substance abuse treatment. I have done groups and individual therapy with adult clients.
