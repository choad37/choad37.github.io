I"ƒ<p>Currently, in-person and online counseling, or teletherapy, are being offered. Due to COVID-19 or your own preference for video sessions, you may opt for privacy protected and HIPAA compliant teletherapy. It will be your responsibility to ensure your privacy is protected by having a session in a private location and with a secure connection.</p>

<p>Sessions are typically 30-60 minutes depending on your needs and availability.</p>

<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>At this time, I am not participating with any insurance networks. However, I am happy to provide a receipt for services and your insurance may reimburse you if they cover out-of-network providers.</p>

<p>Since the initial session is usually a little longer, it costs $100 and lasts about 60-75 minutes. Additional sessions are $75 for 45 minutes. If you prefer or require a shorter session, I can accommodate a 30 minute session for $50.</p>
